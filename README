Make sure you have SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, and SDL_ttf (all in -dev version).

If the bindings fail to compile, run 'hg pull -u' in $GOROOT and rebuild Go.  The release version of Go doesn't have some changes necessary to build the ttf and mixer bindings last I checked.

Music to test SDL_mixer is by Kevin MacLeod.
